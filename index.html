			<blockquote> "And for my entire life, I've been an outsider in my own skin." <i>Forget Me Not</i>, Carolee Dean</blockquote>
				<p>Hello! My name is Catherine McHale, and I am a 21 year old IT student at Oakland University. I was born and raised in Macomb, Michigan for most of my life, but I not live in Harrison Township with my 
				mom and dad. I enjoy reading, playing video games, and being with my boyfriend of nearly two years. I have two cats that live with my boyfriend and a Chilean rose-haired tarantula, which also stays with him.</p>
				<p>I am currently working as a nurse aid for a private hoome health care company and have been doing so for over 2 years. Originally, I was interested in going into medicine, but have since changed career 
				paths. I am currently interested in pursuing a career in either bioinformatics or cybersecurity. To read more about my personal and professional life, please visit my other pages:
